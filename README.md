# FinalProject17
The player arrives on Mars from a spaceship crash and is separated from the crew, who have assumed the player is dead and are seeking refuge in a place on Mars far, far away. The object of the game is for the player to fix a broken satellite, which also crashed in the same area, and use it to call the crew. There will be unexpected challenges along the way, such as a tear in the player's spacesuit and a broken side of the spaceship that needs fixing. The player can use a list of commands, as well as the 'hint' and 'needhelp' functions, that can assist the player in  his/her journey. The game is finished only when the player calls the crew while never dropping to 0% health.
