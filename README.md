# FinalProject17
The player arrives on Mars from a spaceship crash and is separated from the crew, who have assumed the player is dead and are seeking refuge in another region on Mars. The object of the game is for the player to fix a broken satellite and use it to call the crew. There will be unexpected challenges along the way, such as a tear in the spacesuit and a broken side of the spaceship that needs fixing. The only way to win the game is to solve these problems as they appear to eventually call the crew via satellite and be resued from the site of the crash. The player can use a list of commands, as well as the 'hint' and 'needhelp' functions that can assist the player in  his/her journey.
