The player arrives on Mars from a spaceship crash and is separated from the crew, who are waiting for rescuers in an escape pod in an unknown area of the planet. The object of the game is for the player to survive alone with only the supplies from the crashed spaceship until the crew can be contacted. An additional challenge for the player is to prevent the health status from reaching zero.
